/**
 * Problem: Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
 * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot,
 * i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
